TitaniumCoin (TITANIUM) is a blockchain based on the Litecoin code but developed as an independent project. While the architecture and algorithms remain largely unchanged, the goal of the project is to create a blockchain with the potential for further improvement and development.

I have always wanted to create a blockchain and continue its development to enhance all the good aspects that could be implemented. At this point, there is no guarantee that TitaniumCoin will be revolutionary, but I am determined to do everything I can to improve the technology and contribute to the development of cryptocurrencies.

The project is focused on growth and integration into the cryptocurrency community, and I will continue to work on it, develop, and improve it. Many blockchain projects find their place in the cryptocurrency world, while others fade away without finding theirs. Let’s see how this project will develop.

TitaniumCoin is based on the Litecoin code, which is an excellent blockchain, and I have no issues with it. I simply like the structure and concept of Litecoin, so I used its code as the foundation for creating TitaniumCoin.

### Characteristics

    Algorithm: Scrypt

    Block reward: 30 TITANIUM

    Block time: 3 minutes

    Total supply: 300,000,000 coins

    Block size: 4 MB

    Pre-mining: 1% of the total supply for the developer

    Mining: Currently, only solo mining is used; pools are not supported.

### Goals and Mission

TitaniumCoin is being created as an independent blockchain focused on honesty, openness, and development. I am not promising that this project will be revolutionary, but I strive to improve and make the blockchain more efficient and accessible.

Cryptocurrencies are not just an innovation; they are a reality that already has a significant impact on the financial sector and technologies. I believe that cryptocurrencies are the future, and TitaniumCoin is a step in that direction. We are living in an era of change, and blockchain technologies could become the foundation for creating a more transparent and secure financial system.

It is planned that TitaniumCoin will develop gradually, with a focus on improving security, stability, and ease of use. I am working on the project independently, and I would be happy if it has a positive impact on the cryptocurrency community.

### Notes

This project is not a commercial initiative, but rather an experiment in blockchain technologies. I am not promising big profits or instant success, but I am focused on long-term development and improving the technologies.
